<h3>08/2012 - 05/2014 : Open world story based hacker themed world with seamless multiplayer (PS4/XB1/X360/PS3/PC)</h3>
<p>My role was on the multiplayer game play team.</p>
<h4>Game modes</h4>
<p>I was a team member for 'online game play' where I worked with designers to create various game modes and pieces of the mission system. Watch_Dogs multi-player features join in progress, host migration and seamless transitions for the 'invasion' style game play.</p>
<h4>Parties and Invites</h4>
<p>I was also a team member for 'online engine' programming which had me focusing on 'game invites' and 'party' functionality on the Xbox one and PS4.</p>
<h4>MP Audio</h4>
<p>I (once again) put together a simple system so that 'barks' (caharacter speach) could be easily played.</p>
<h4>Mentor-ship</h4>
<p>I was able to guide some online programmers from another studio in the creation of a new multiplayer experince which unfortunately for cut from the game, but it was a very rewarding experince.</p>

<p>Working with SIP bindings to enable game play code to be called from Python. Created custom mappings from C++ template containers to Python structures. Re-purposed ‘2D cut scene’ tool to make a high performance visual OSD system. Scriptable menu crawling automation system for in-game UI and mission testing.</p>
<h4>Scaleform</h4>
<p>Full front end flow and implementation. Actionscript knowledge and debugging skills. Worked extensively with and managed output of art assets from the Chengdu, China office.</p>
<h4>Havok</h4>
<p>Lightweight ‘Props’ object hierarchy for spawning weapons and dynamic objects in world from script and C++; designed and coded all cross game code, game specific code and build process. Set up of locomotion anima- tions with Behaviour tool. Optimization of AI local avoidance by re-writing collision detection in Havok.</p>
<h4>Audio engine</h4>
<p>Created the build process and game interfaces to use a custom audio engine. Global, per-context and per- mission archive loading. Baked archive offsets so strings didn’t have to be used outside of loading code.</p>

                <p>Outside of work I am a keen hobbyist programmer. I am keen on learning new ways to solve problems whether it is via learning new frameworks, engines, or completely new (to me) programming paradigms.</p>
<h1>Python</h1>
<p>I was introduced to the <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> programming language from my time working at Eutechnyx. It was mainly used for the asset building system scripts. There was a good level of understanding of the language in the office, but only a select set of it's features where regularly used (C written in Python). 
After some very interesting conversations inside the office I took my learning home and opened my post-graduate C++ programmers mind to all kinds of <em>exotic</em> concepts: List comprehension, generators, descriptors, curries, partial functions and so on.</p>
<p>I don't claim to be a master at <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> (or <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">C++</a>), but I has made me a very <em>multi-lingual</em> programmer. I pick up and can work in different languages/domains relatively easily. I'm also hungry to learn about as many programming concepts and languages as I can find time to.</p>
<h1>Linux &amp; Websites</h1>
<p>Linux programming was something that I was vastly unaware of. I touched on working with the terminal while in university, but it never really clicked with me. Like most curiosities of mine, the effort to stick at it was missing until I found a good project to sink my teeth into. I was previously working on a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> based website under Windows 7 but started to run into issues with my Python install, the package manager and other web tech such as Apache. I made the jump over to Ubuntu and after many days of hair pulling I got the first signs of life out of my website codebase. After some trial and error I was at the point I stopped at on Windows and ran straight onto the battlefield of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war"><em>"Text Editor Wars"</em></a>... A few more weeks and I was able to edit text again inside of <a href="http://vim.org">VIM</a>. Finally after adding some new features to my website I had to find a new version control system. With <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> the stage was set for my to actually work code in a Linux environment!</p>
<p>Sadly the Django project never took the the web due how basic it was compared to the extra cost from the web service needed to run it. Luckily all of that template knowledge was transferred to <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> and <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja2</a> which is what my current dot com is running off; full tech specs on the <a href="http://nathanrosspowell.com/credits">credits</a> page.</p>
<p>A favourite thing about Linux is that my multiple machines all have access to git and there fore are a few commands from cloning and installing (via a bash script) my entire working environment from my <a href="http://github.com/nathanrosspowell/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> repository. The power, speed and <em>simplicity</em> of a CLI has really helped my productivity (cliched Linux claim, I know).  </p>
<h1>Project Euler</h1>
<p>To keep my Linux skills sharp I needed some projects and from the recommendation of a friend I found the <em>endless</em> challenge of <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> to try and get my teeth around. My point of entry for expanding my mind on problem solving. My <a href="https://github.com/nathanrosspowell/euler/#project-euler">euler</a> Github repro where my current solutions (and work in progresses) can be found. Most are solved with C++ and Python, but I've been starting to use <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> to get to grips with the quirks and advantages of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>. </p>
<h1>Unity</h1>
<p><a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a> is the engine that I have been doing my game play experiments in. Using Unity I'm able to attach <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh388566.aspx">C#</a> scripts to objects in the game world and get experimenting with my ideas that I have for game play. It's a very useful tool to remove distraction from the trap of programming a game <em>engine</em> instead of an actual game.</p>
<p>Hopefully at some point I will be hosting some demos and small games through the Unity we plugin on my site.</p>
