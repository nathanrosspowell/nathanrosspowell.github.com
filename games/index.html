              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>Set in Chicago, where a central network of computers connects everyone and everything, Watch_Dogs explores the impact of technology within our society. Using the city as your weapon, you will embark on a personal mission to inflict your
                own brand of justice.</p>
              <p>Chicago's overarching network is known as the Central Operating System (ctOS), and it controls almost all of the city's technology and information - including key data on all of the city's residents.</p>
              <p>You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. While seeking justice for those events, you'll monitor and hack those around you by manipulating the ctOS from the palm of
                your hand. You'll access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy... and more.</p>
              <h2>ctOS</h2>
              <p>The ctOS is an efficient system linking all the city's infrastructure and public security installations to one centralized hub. This system focuses on traffic efficiency, eco-development, tele-communications, and crime control throughout
                Chicago. It has brought notable benefits to citizens, including shorter commutes, lowered crime rates, a cleaner city, and much more.</p>
              <h2>Chicago</h2>
              <p>Watch_Dogs takes place in a contemporary Chicago that's been enhanced and transformed by the ctOS. In this version of Chicago, everything is connected. Banks, security systems, communication hubs, and even the city's basic infrastructure
                operate via the this connected network. The ctOS provides a new take on one of the world's great cities, and it's this omniscient setting that serves as the backdrop for Aiden's story.</p>

              <p>Taking a small step into the future, Red River depicts a fictional conflict with contemporary geopolitical themes, which will unfold over three distinct acts in both single player and drop-in-drop-out co-operative play for up to four players
                online. Faced with new counter-insurgency combat and the returning threat of the Chinese PLA, players will feel the tension, brutality and carnage of modern conflict from the perspective of a marine fireteam on deployment in a hostile
                country, thousands of miles from home.</p>

              <p>Between Afghanistan and China, the world’s next flashpoint is about to erupt. The valleys, towns and mountains of Tajikistan will become bloody frontlines for the might of the People’s Liberation Army, insurgent guerrilla fighters and the
                United States Marine Corps.</p>
              <p>You and your fireteam can make a difference. How much is up to you. It’s not the soldier with the most expensive gun or the biggest heart who wins on the battlefield. It’s the smartest. Semper Fi, Marine.</p>

              <p>The game is set in the last years of the roaring 1960’s, a time of Sex, Drugs and Rock ‘N Roll. The biker movement, rock music and the hippie counterculture all add to the fascinating atmosphere to be experienced in ‘Ride to Hell’.</p>
              <p>Action loaded from the very start with free roaming environments, players can immerse themselves in the liberty and freedom of riding full throttle with their gang on a multitude of different vehicles through the dusty flats of Western America.
                Protecting their turf, their brothers and their machines from rival gangs is just a taste of what this epic game will involve.</p>
              <p>‘Ride to Hell’ is not for the faint hearted; it’s aimed heavily at the player who wants to become fully involved in the original West Coast biker culture. With its hard drinking, bare knuckle environment, this is as close to the action as
                you can get.</p>
              <p>In a movie style production model, the internal Deep Silver studio is teaming up with leading creative companies such as Eutechnyx, Perspective Studios, and others, to bring the authentic and massive game world of ‘Ride to Hell’ to life.</p>
              <p>“The Deep Silver development team has worked on some of the greatest and grittiest, freeform-style games to ever hit the market,” Cathy Tische, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Deep Silver, Inc. “They are pulling out all the stops
                to bring the biker gang world alive in Ride to Hell, from the 1960s art style, music and scenery to the completely raw and intense game play.”</p>
              <p>"Ride to Hell is one of Deep Silver’s largest global multiplatform game launches to date and one that will put Deep Silver on the map in the US,” says Hannes Seifert, Managing Director at the Deep Silver development studio. “Ride to Hell
                captures the spirit of the biker movement in the 1960s, while delivering an authentic, action-packed game play experience.”</p>

              <p>This was my first 'full' game that I made under my own steam. I had been feeling like I had very little to show in the way of a portfolio and I starting to think about applying for placement year jobs.</p>
              <p>I gave myself a small twist on the classic game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">Asteroids</a> by introducing gravity pull. When you got into the lower section of the screen (where the image of the planet was)
                the ships sields would lower and make an annoying alert noise. Too long, and you'd explode losing one life. Leave the danger zone and the shields would recharge.</p>
              <p>A number of pickups where introuced being three sizes of bullet and finally a triple fire laser. You would get points for shooting the asteroids and the high scores would save out to a data file.</p>
              <p>Sadly the code was built against a custom engine written by my lecture at the time and I cannot seem to get the correct libs on my computer to compile it (Visual Studio 2005 and Direct Draw).</p>
              <p>I have a plan to either port the code to another 'engine' or to remake the gameplay in Unity3D.</p>

              <p>Snake 3D was my design for my 'Gamecube Programming' module in Uni. I wanted to take the two dimensional playing field of a normal game of [snake][snake] and add one more dimension to it so that it was taking place inside of a cube.</p>
              <p>I learned a great deal about how interesting ideas do not always turn out to be fun game play wise! Traversing the extra dimension was not easy for a player to get their head around and extra markers had to be made help indicate depth in
                the wireframe grid/cube/level.</p>
              <p>Luckily as it was a programming assigment I managed to tick all of the game requirements and get good marks. Still to this day I am puzzled over how it would be best to navigate the three dimensions whithout the average player losing their
                bearings.</p>
              <p>Hopefully I will be able to find the files to run it in an emulator of some sorts to get some screen caps.</p>
