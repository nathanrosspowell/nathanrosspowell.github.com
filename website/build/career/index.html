    <p>This section is a little bit dry for casual reading, I have to admit. This first section is 90% a translation of my current CV for easier reading on the web. The <a href="#other-experience">Other Experience</a> section is a bit more explanitory on my outside-of-work programming and learnings. Lastly you can find the PDF version of my CV for download if you so wish.</p>

<p>Member of the game team. Appointed responsibility for game modes and key systems critical to the
projects success inside of an extremely short time frame.</p>
<h4>Game modes and components</h4>
<p>Primary responsibility were the Joyride - progression and unlock based freeride gameplay; and Knockout and Transporter game modes, which were made to work in career, online and spectator modes. Tight feed back loops with design and playtest sessions to iterate gameplay. Lots of experience with making the best use of data driven component architectures - refactored code functionality into reusable generic components.  Data driven codebase Masses of work using and improving the game DB system. Task with refactoring DB usage and making game code as data driven as possible. Usability wrappers classes generated from the DB schema to simplify use and improve correctness. Refactored achievements implementations down to core types that are database driven with one line class creation. Implemented half the games achievements.</p>
<h4>Audio speech system</h4>
<p>A system no-one in the team had knowledge on, or wanted to take responsibility for. Used proven skills with legacy code to decipher and fix bugs in a multi threaded environment. Updated data editing tools and leased with design and producers to add features and fix countless bugs.</p>
<h4>Additional</h4>
<p>Produced high level project estimations for majority of game code. Designers first point of contact for build stability issues - making rapid ‘same day’ fixes. Mentoring and learning with lesser experienced team members with pair programming sessions.<br />
</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>06/2011 - 09/2011 : Chosen to be on a new ideation team with the aims of moving Codemasters into new areas of the games market. Also focusing on new development processes and technologies.</p>
<h4>R&amp;D</h4>
<p>Technical research on fitness for purpose on a selection of available middlewares. Large part of dev was done in Unity3D targeting iOS. Worked on an unannounced project until it was greenlit.</p>
<h4>Role change</h4>
<p>Underwent internal design training and leadership testing (Strength.Deployment.Inventory). Being directly in- volved in the design process of new ideas, a large part of my work was rapidly prototyping UI and game mechanics to use in presentations and live demos.<br />

<p>Member of the gameplay team, involved with multiple scrums through out the project. Responsible for patch, DLC and Japan SKU post release.</p>
<h3>Characters, weapons and equipment</h3>
<p>Main focus on the players controls of inventory, ballistics, context sensitive actions, weapon customisation, vehicle and weapon mounting. With tasks and bugs distributed to me I had the chance to work closely with design, physics, animation and UI teams. Working with a component based entity system. Commended by peers for task completion ahead of schedule.<br />
</p>
<h4>Networking &amp; join in progress (JIP)</h4>
<p>Developing a 4-player co-op main campaign. Extensive ‘hooking up’ of game systems over the network. Ex- perienced in syncing of static and dynamic objects states for a JIP environment. Refactoring to achieve a single code path in replacement of online/offline paths. Xbox 360 auto-launcher tool to get four machines into networked gameplay without needing to deal with any menus.</p>
<h4>Havok</h4>
<p>Working with rigid body and phantom set ups and physics layers to get players and vehicles interacting with the gameplay actions. Using animation events to make remote networked characters perform the correct actions (vaulting, mounting etc.). Fixed countless physics edge cases inside an open world, tweaking bounding box sizes, adding ray casts, tweaking friction values etc.</p>
<h4>Mission design</h4>
<p>Full purpose built tutorial system used with actions and triggered from mission script (Lua). XML definitions of tutorial strings, button presses and flow that were reusable. Exposing key functionality to Lua for optimal mission script flexibility and efficiency. Close work with mission designers and UI teams.</p>
<h4>Prototyping</h4>
<p>Worked on an always synced ‘Actions’ system to simplify coding new static and dynamic objects with an action (ammo crates, mines, etc). Created an in-game (3D) replication of the 2D character and weapon customisation menus and functionality.</p>

    </header>
    <p>Outside of work I am a keep hobbiest programmer. I am keen on learning new ways to solve problems wether it is via learning new frameworks, engines, or completely new (to me) programming paradigms.</p>
<h1>Python</h1>
<p>I was introduced to the <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> programming language from my time working at Eutechnyx. It was mainly used for the asset building system scripts. There was a good level of understanding of the language in the office, but only a select set of it's features where regularly used (C written in Python). 
After some very interesting converstations inside the office I took my learning home and opened my post-graduate C++ programmers mind to all kinds of <em>exotic</em> concepts: List comprehension, generators, descriptors, curries, partial functions and so on.</p>
<p>I don't claim to be a master at <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> (or <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">C++</a>), but I has made me a very <em>multi-lingual</em> programmer. I pick up and can work in different languages/domains relativly easily. I'm also hungry to learn about as many programming concepts and languages as I can find time to.</p>
<h1>Linux &amp; Websites</h1>
<p>Linux programming was something that I was vasty unawear of. I touched on working with the terminal while in university, but it never really clicked with me. Like most curiosities of mine, the effort to stick at it was missing until I found a good project to sink my teeth into. I was previously working on a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> based website under Windows 7 but started to run into issues with my Python install, the package manager and othe web tech such as Apache. I made the jump over to Ubuntu and after many days of hair pulling I got the first signs of life out of my website codebase. After some trial and error I was at the point I stopped at on Windows and ran straight onto the battlefield of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war"><em>"Text Editor Wars"</em></a>... A few more weeks and I was able to edit text again indside of <a href="http://vim.org">VIM</a>. Finally after adding some new features to my website I had to find a new version control system. With <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> the stage was set for my to actually work code in a linux enviroment!</p>
<p>Sadly the Django project never took the the web due how basic it was compaired to the extra cost from the webservice needed to run it. Lucily all of that template knowledge was transfered to <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> and [Jinja2][jina] which is what my current dot com is running off; full tech specs on the <a href="http://nathanrosspowell.com/credits">credits</a> page.</p>
<p>A favorite thing about Linux is that my multiple machines all have access to git and there fore are a few commands from cloning and installing (via a bash script) my entire working enviroment from my <a href="http://github.com/nathanrosspowell/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> repository. The power, speed and <em>simplicity</em> of a CLI has really helped my productivity (cliched Linux claim, I know).<br />
</p>
<h1>Project Euler</h1>
<p>To keep my Linux skills sharp I needed some projects and from the recommendation of a friend I found the <em>endless</em> challenge of <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> to try and get my teeth around. My point of entry for expanding my mind on problem sovling. My <a href="https://github.com/nathanrosspowell/euler/#project-euler">euler</a> Github repro where my current solutions (and work in progresses) can be found. Most are solved with C++ and Python, but I've been starting to use <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> to get to grips with the quirks and advantages of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>. </p>
<h1>Unity</h1>
<p><a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a> is the engine that I have been doing my game play experiments in. Using Unity I'm able to attach <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh388566.aspx">C#</a> scripts to objects in the game world and get experimenting with my ideas that I have for game play. It's a very useful tool to remove distraction from the trap of programming a game <em>engine</em> instead of an actual game.</p>
<p>Hopefully at some point I will be hosting some demos and small games through the Unity we plugin on my site.</p>
