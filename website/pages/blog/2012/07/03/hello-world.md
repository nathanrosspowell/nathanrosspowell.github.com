This is the first _blog_ entry onto my newly made website. I'm not sure what is going to end up on this page, but hopefully it will be a means to communicate my hobby code to the wider world.

I've got a comment system working ([Disqus][disqus]) and the next thing to add is code highlighting. A filter for _tags_ needs to be set up for all of the blog conntent and 
fFinally, the style could do with some work, but this is as nice as a v0.1 as any.
