So tomorrow is the start of a new chapter in my career and life as I will be starting work at Ubisoft Montréal on the muchly anticipated Watch_Dogs video game.

I've been in the country for a couple of days now and have just about adapted to the time and the heat.

Not much else to say for now other than my French is embarissingly terrible and I feel like a total dingus whenever I try and converse with a francaphone. Time to see if there is any crossover from being multi-lingual in programming languages...
