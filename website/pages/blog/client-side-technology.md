I made a few toy websites recently with a wide range of tools that are are freely available for anyone to use.
Read on to find out where this journey led me.


[Interface Zero][interfacezero]
===============================

Interface Zero is a pen and paper role play game in which you can create your own characters.
The idea was to make a website that is accessable on all devices which displays the stat sheets for multiple characters.

The stat sheets are full of numbers for ability values, names of weapons and notes for characters edges and hinderences.
A good fit for storing this in a human readable state is the [YAML][yaml] format.
Unfortunatly it is not handle nativly in Javascript, but library version of [js-yaml][js-yaml] can convert it to a [JSON][json] format at run time. 

The Flask framework has been used put together the [NathanRossPowell domain][nrp], but it is a fair bit of work and a machine that is correctly set up is needed to make edits and deploy the website. 
It is not ideal if the goal is to have a website which will display a small amout of data on a 'one page' website.

Usign Javascript (with jQuerey) it is trivial to dynamically append content to a section of HTML.
With the basic structure of the web page in orders, a JS file can loop over all of the stat sheets (which are in JSON format) and add body content and header navigation for each of them.
Writing out something to a string with gets added to a HTML element looks something like this:

    :::javascript
    var buildHtml = "";
    buildHtml += '<a class="anchor" id="' + contactsId(name) + '"></a>';
    // etc...
    $("#interfacezero-main").append(buildHtml)

The method is to append the dynamic values to a semi-formed html string and then add the closing element.
It is not a elegent method and it becomes very hard to read when nested elements are being created.
This method is also harder to debug.
Unlike static webpage deploys, using the 'View Source' function of a browser does not show you what is being displayed on screen.
More advanced features of your browsers development tools will need to be used.
In [Google Chrome][chrome] the cursor should be placed on the HTML element of choice, then the right click menu will display and option to `inspect element`.
This will show all of the HTML that has been dynamically generated by the Javascript functions.

Maintaining this code and adding new features can be painful.
Luckily once all of the values in the YAML stat sheets have been represented in HTML, there is not much to be done other than update the stat sheets as the role play campaign progresses.

The use of Github Pages means that collaborators can safely update a version controlled character sheet and then see the changes (almost) instantly due to the dynamic nature of the HTML generation.
Githubs extensive web interface controls mean that updating character sheets can done from any device.
Editing the files with a mobile device can be a bit tricky, but that is down to Githubs controls inside of their browser text editor.

Overall this project was a good learning experience and it highlights the need for some kind of HTML templating engine when dealing with dynamic values.

==============

There are a number of templating engines that are targeted at the HTML generation.
