Well the website fell away to rot for a bit... Other things were more important, but today I finished a pass on making it nice and shiny again!

Some effort has gone into fixing the litter errors that crept in last time I tried to optimise the Javascript execution on the pages.
Along with that and a small redesign and palette change we end up here, with what you see before you.

Code wise I have been working on a Linux based SDL powered 'game engine'. 
A typical task for most programmers, and I'm falling into the classic gotchas of over engineering things yadda yadda - end of the day, it's fun.
This is currently in one of my private github repros, but it will surface as soon as some kind of tech demo is working.

As usual I'm updating my site as a gust of enthusiasm has taken over me. Not sure how long it will last.
