=========================================================================

### 09/2011 - 05/2012 : Arcade racing with destruction modes (X360/PS3/PC)

Member of the game team. Appointed responsibility for game modes and key systems critical to the
projects success inside of an extremely short time frame.

#### Game modes and components

Primary responsibility were the Joyride - progression and unlock based free ride game play; and Knockout and Transporter game modes, which were made to work in career, online and spectator modes. Tight feed back loops with design and play test sessions to iterate game play. Lots of experience with making the best use of data driven component architectures - re-factored code functionality into reusable generic components.  Data driven codebase Masses of work using and improving the game DB system. Task with re-factoring DB usage and making game code as data driven as possible. Usability wrappers classes generated from the DB schema to simplify use and improve correctness. Re-factored achievements implementations down to core types that are database driven with one line class creation. Implemented half the games achievements.

#### Audio speech system

A system no-one in the team had knowledge on, or wanted to take responsibility for. Used proven skills with legacy code to decipher and fix bugs in a multi threaded environment. Updated data editing tools and leased with design and producers to add features and fix countless bugs.

#### Additional

Produced high level project estimations for majority of game code. Designers first point of contact for build stability issues - making rapid ‘same day’ fixes. Mentoring and learning with lesser experienced team members with pair programming sessions.
