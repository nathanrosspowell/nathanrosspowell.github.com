===========================================================================================

### 08/2010 - 06/2011 : Authentic military co-op FPS (X360/PS3/PC).

Member of the game play team, involved with multiple scrums through out the project. Responsible for patch, DLC and Japan SKU post release.

~### Characters, weapons and equipment

Main focus on the players controls of inventory, ballistics, context sensitive actions, weapon customization, vehicle and weapon mounting. With tasks and bugs distributed to me I had the chance to work closely with design, physics, animation and UI teams. Working with a component based entity system. Commended by peers for task completion ahead of schedule.  

#### Networking & join in progress (JIP)

Developing a 4-player co-op main campaign. Extensive ‘hooking up’ of game systems over the network. Ex- perienced in syncing of static and dynamic objects states for a JIP environment. Re-factoring to achieve a single code path in replacement of online/offline paths. Xbox 360 auto-launcher tool to get four machines into networked game play without needing to deal with any menus.

#### Havok

Working with rigid body and phantom set ups and physics layers to get players and vehicles interacting with the game play actions. Using animation events to make remote networked characters perform the correct actions (vaulting, mounting etc.). Fixed countless physics edge cases inside an open world, tweaking bounding box sizes, adding ray casts, tweaking friction values etc.

#### Mission design

Full purpose built tutorial system used with actions and triggered from mission script (Lua). XML definitions of tutorial strings, button presses and flow that were reusable. Exposing key functionality to Lua for optimal mission script flexibility and efficiency. Close work with mission designers and UI teams.

#### Prototyping

Worked on an always synced ‘Actions’ system to simplify coding new static and dynamic objects with an action (ammo crates, mines, etc). Created an in-game (3D) replication of the 2D character and weapon customization menus and functionality.

#### Additional

Strong experience debugging release crash dumps on all platforms. Team member picked to be part of the rapid prototyping scrum. Working in a fully Agile team. Graded ‘Straight A’ in internal appraisals.
