Industry Experience at [Eutechnyx][etx] on [Hot Wheels: Beat That!][hotwheels]
==============================================================================

### Kart-like power-upâ€™d racing (X360/PS2/Wii/PC) 06/2007 - 10/2007

First industry title, working under the only other UI programmer, then taking charge when they left.

#### User interface

Working with in house tech/tools to get the front end working. Localisation of all platforms and SKUs - a lot of personal effort to fix strings and images for deadlines. Cross platform specific screen set up. TCR/TRC/Lotcheck knowledge. Overseeing multiple SKU branch integrations during shipping.

#### Load/Save

Carry over of platform check knowledge to bug fix the Load/Save code. Extensive work on the PS2.
