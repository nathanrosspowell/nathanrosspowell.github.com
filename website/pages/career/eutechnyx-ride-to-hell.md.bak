### 3rd person open world action (X360/PS3/PC - Shelved) 10/2007 - 03/2010

New engine developed for Eutechnyx’s first action title. Worked on a small pre-production team with varied tasks, then worked mainly with Scaleform, Havok, Audio and the build process in full production.

#### Engine

Working with SIP bindings to enable gameplay code to be called from Python. Created custom mappings from C++ template containers to Python structures. Re-purposed ‘2D cutscene’ tool to make a high performance visual OSD system. Scriptable menu crawling automation system for in-game UI and mission testing.

#### Scaleform

Full front end flow and implementation. Actionscript knowledge and debugging skills. Worked extensively with and managed output of art assets from the Chengdu, China office.

#### Havok

Lightweight ‘Props’ object hierarchy for spawning weapons and dynamic objects in world from script and C++; designed and coded all cross game code, game specific code and build process. Set up of locomotion anima- tions with Behaviour tool. Optimisation of AI local avoidance by re-writing collision detection in Havok.

#### Audio engine

Created the build process and game interfaces to use a custom audio engine. Global, per-context and per- mission archive loading. Baked archive offsets so strings didn’t have to be used outside of loading code.
