Industry Experience at [Ubisoft][ubi] on [Watch_Dogs][watchdogs]
================================================================

### 08/2012 - 05/2014 : Open world story based hacker themed world with seamless multiplayer (PS4/XB1/X360/PS3/PC)

My role was on the multiplayer game play team.

#### Game modes

I was a team member for 'online game play' where I worked with designers to create various game modes and pieces of the mission system. Watch_Dogs multi-player features join in progress, host migration and seamless transitions for the 'invasion' style game play.

#### Parties and Invites

I was also a team member for 'online engine' programming which had me focusing on 'game invites' and 'party' functionality on the Xbox one and PS4.

#### MP Audio

I (once again) put together a simple system so that 'barks' (caharacter speach) could be easily played.

#### Mentor-ship

I was able to guide some online programmers from another studio in the creation of a new multiplayer experince which unfortunately for cut from the game, but it was a very rewarding experince.
