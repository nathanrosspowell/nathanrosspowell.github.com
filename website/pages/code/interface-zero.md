short: A mobile first responsive website made to display Interface Zero character sheers and more.

I decided to try and make another website, this time a simple interface to display a character sheer for the pen and paper role play game Interface Zero.

I went with a crude method of using JavaScript to pull data from YAML files and generate boostrap styled HTML.
