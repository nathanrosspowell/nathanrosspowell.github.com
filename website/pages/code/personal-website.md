short: "This very website! A static pages site delevoped with Flash and Frozen Flask python software and hosted on GitHub Pages"

This is the source for the second personal website that I wrote from scratch, but the very first that made it online. Previously I had played with the Django web framework. While Django is very powerful, it was a bit much for my usage. 

After learning of the Jekyll software which serves up static websites I looked for a python equivalent (as that is something I am comfortable with) and found the Frozen Flask app for the Flask framework. The rest is, as they say, history.
