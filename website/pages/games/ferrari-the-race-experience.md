Ferrari's latest and hottest marques, along with its motors past and present, are poised to vroom onto PlayStation3 with the September 29 launch of Ferrari The Race Experience.

Ferrari The Race Experience will be available exclusively from the PlayStation Network Store in this major videogames industry breakthrough.  Players of all disciplines – yes, even novices to the track – can recreate the excitement, the sounds, the action and the vibrant colours of real-life racing for hours of motoring enjoyment.

Poised for action on the starting line are Ferrari’s new much-acclaimed 458 Italia and the powerhouse that is the 599XX. They are just two of the many new models introduced into Ferrari The Race Experience, which follows hot on the wheels of the much-acclaimed Ferrari Challenge that launched two years ago.
