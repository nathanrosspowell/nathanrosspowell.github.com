The game is set in the last years of the roaring 1960’s, a time of Sex, Drugs and Rock ‘N Roll. The biker movement, rock music and the hippie counterculture all add to the fascinating atmosphere to be experienced in ‘Ride to Hell’.  

Action loaded from the very start with free roaming environments, players can immerse themselves in the liberty and freedom of riding full throttle with their gang on a multitude of different vehicles through the dusty flats of Western America. Protecting their turf, their brothers and their machines from rival gangs is just a taste of what this epic game will involve.  

‘Ride to Hell’ is not for the faint hearted; it’s aimed heavily at the player who wants to become fully involved in the original West Coast biker culture. With its hard drinking, bare knuckle environment, this is as close to the action as you can get.  

In a movie style production model, the internal Deep Silver studio is teaming up with leading creative companies such as Eutechnyx, Perspective Studios, and others, to bring the authentic and massive game world of ‘Ride to Hell’ to life.  

“The Deep Silver development team has worked on some of the greatest and grittiest, freeform-style games to ever hit the market,” Cathy Tische, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Deep Silver, Inc. “They are pulling out all the stops to bring the biker gang world alive in Ride to Hell, from the 1960s art style, music and scenery to the completely raw and intense game play.”  

"Ride to Hell is one of Deep Silver’s largest global multiplatform game launches to date and one that will put Deep Silver on the map in the US,” says Hannes Seifert, Managing Director at the Deep Silver development studio. “Ride to Hell captures the spirit of the biker movement in the 1960s, while delivering an authentic, action-packed game play experience.”
