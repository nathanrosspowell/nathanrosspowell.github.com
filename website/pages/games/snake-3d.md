Snake 3D was my design for my 'Gamecube Programming' module in Uni. I wanted to take the two dimensional playing field of a normal game of [snake][snake] and add one more dimension to it so that it was taking place inside of a cube.

I learned a great deal about how interesting ideas do not always turn out to be fun game play wise! Traversing the extra dimension was not easy for a player to get their head around and extra markers had to be made help indicate depth in the wireframe grid/cube/level.

Luckily as it was a programming assigment I managed to tick all of the game requirements and get good marks. Still to this day I am puzzled over how it would be best to navigate the three dimensions whithout the average player losing their bearings.

Hopefully I will be able to find the files to run it in an emulator of some sorts to get some screen caps.
