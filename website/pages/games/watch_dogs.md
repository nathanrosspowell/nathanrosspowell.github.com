Overview
--------

Set in Chicago, where a central network of computers connects everyone and everything, Watch_Dogs explores the impact of technology within our society. Using the city as your weapon, you will embark on a personal mission to inflict your own brand of justice.

Chicago's overarching network is known as the Central Operating System (ctOS), and it controls almost all of the city's technology and information - including key data on all of the city's residents.

You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. While seeking justice for those events, you'll monitor and hack those around you by manipulating the ctOS from the palm of your hand. You'll access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy... and more.

ctOS
----

The ctOS is an efficient system linking all the city's infrastructure and public security installations to one centralized hub. This system focuses on traffic efficiency, eco-development, tele-communications, and crime control throughout Chicago. It has brought notable benefits to citizens, including shorter commutes, lowered crime rates, a cleaner city, and much more.

Chicago
-------

Watch_Dogs takes place in a contemporary Chicago that's been enhanced and transformed by the ctOS. In this version of Chicago, everything is connected. Banks, security systems, communication hubs, and even the city's basic infrastructure operate via the this connected network. The ctOS provides a new take on one of the world's great cities, and it's this omniscient setting that serves as the backdrop for Aiden's story.
