This section is a little bit dry for casual reading, I have to admit. This first section is 90% a translation of my current CV for easier reading on the web. The [Other Experience][otherxp] section is a bit more explanitory on my outside-of-work programming and learnings. Lastly you can find the PDF version of my CV for download if you so wish.
